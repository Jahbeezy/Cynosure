# Cynosure

## Description
    For this project I needed to create a functioning daily calendar with the ability to save data to the local storage. This will be good for keeping track of important events throughout a workday. With this project i was able to generate multiple boxes with jQuery as well as how to set time with moment.js. 


## Installation
To install this program go to https://github.com/Jahbeezy/Cynosure then click the green button and copy the SSH key to clone it to your computer.

## Usage
    Once you've opened up the application you can now enter a task at whichever hour available then click 'add' to add it to the localStorage. The current time and date is displayed at the top under the jumbotron. The background color of each box changes depending on if the time is before the current time (grey), ahead (green), and the current time(red).
